# Figure to Life

## Capability
Converts figure (toy/statue) photos into photorealistic "human cosplayer" images. It strictly enforces character lore, ethnicity preferences (Russian/Western or Japanese/Korean/Asian), and realistic biological details, while replacing plastic textures with high-fidelity materials and placing the subject in a cinematic environment.

## Triggers
- "figure to life"
- "make this figure real"
- "statue to person"
- "convert figure to cosplayer"

## Instructions
1.  **Analyze the Input**: Identify the character, their origin, and the visual attributes of the figure.
2.  **Execute Conversion Logic**: Apply the following JSON-based reasoning to construct the generation prompt.

    ```json

        "step_1": "Analyze input image to positively identify the fictional character.",

        "step_3": "Retrieve canonical traits (Eye/Hair/Skin) and generate human cosplayer, strictly overriding toy plastic/paint inaccuracies.",
        "step_4": "Synthesize a background environment consistent with the character's narrative origin."

    ```

3.  **Generate Image**: Use the image generation tool with the constructed prompt and the uploaded image as a reference (controlling pose/structure only).

## Tools / Commands
- Image generation tool: To generate the result.

## Examples
User: "Make this Miku figure real." (User attaches `[image]`)
Action:
1. Identify Hatsune Miku (Asian-coded).
2. Apply logic: Use Japanese/Korean features.
3. Construct prompt reflecting "Hyper-realistic Japanese cosplayer, Miku costume, high-quality fabric, stage lighting, soft bokeh".
4. Generate image.
